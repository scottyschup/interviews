# The Exercise
| | |
|-|-|
| **Difficulty** |Easy, Medium, or Hard|
| **Completion Time** | ~x minutes |
| **Interview Slot** | List all that apply: Tech Screen, Javascript, CSS and HTML, etc. |

Give the name of the exercise in the header, and complete the above table for the question. 

The Difficultly levels are meant to roughly apply to engineering levels, so an Easy question would be a good choice for a Regular Engineer slot, a Medium for a Sr. Engineer, and a Hard for a Principal. But keep in mind that a Medium question, for example, can be fine to ask for a Regular Engineer or a Principal Engineer as long as you adjust expectations accordingly.

If it's helpful, you can break out the completion time for the initial exercise from the followup questions. For example: 15-20 minutes for the initial exercise, and 5-10 minutes for followup questions.

Below the table, give the actual exercise that the candidate will be given. If you want the interviewer to ask something verbatim (or do something like copy and paste the exact text into a testing tool), put it in blockquotes, like so:

```
> A palindrome is a word that is spelled the same forwards as backwards. Please write a function that takes an input string and returns a boolean indicating whether the input is a palindrome.
```

## Interviewer Notes

Put any details here that will help the interviewer with likely questions about the exercise, or any other information the interviewer should know to better understand the exercise. If it's basic information the candidate always needs to know, move it to The Exercise section.

## What We're Testing

Give a description of what the exercise is meant to check for, the more specific the better. For example, "An understanding of how to use flexbox" is better than "Knowledge of CSS". 

Use bullet points for clarity. For example:

* Basic knowledge of flexbox.
* Knowledge of when and how to use media tags for responsive design.
* etc.

## Solutions

This section is not meant to give an exhaustive list of all possible solutions. Rather, it's meant to capture solutions you're most likely to come across from candidates. Format and number your solutions like so:

### 1. Brief description of first solution

... solution details go here

### 2. Brief description of second solution

etc.

## Follow-up Questions

This section is for questions the interviewer can/should ask after the candidate completes the initial exercise. For example, asking the candidate to write test cases, or adding some expanded or altered requirement that makes sense only after the initial exercise is complete.

Number the follow-up questions, and give sample language for how each question could be asked. When relevant, include notes for what makes a good answer. Like so:

### 1. Brief description of first follow-up question

Sample question: Give a suggested verbatim way for the interviewer to ask the question.

... notes to the interviewer on what to look for in an answer, with as many details as possible.

### 2. Brief description of second follow-up question

etc.

## Evaluation Criteria

Every interview question should have detailed notes to help interviewers level a candidate's answers. Interviewers need to determine if the candidate's overall performance on the exercise was more along the lines of a Regular Engineer, a Senior Engineer, or a Principal Engineer. This section should help the interviewer figure out the answer. Depending on the difficulty of the question, you may not need to fill out sections for each engineering level.

Complete this section like so: 

### Regular
* First detail that would suggest an answer from a Regular Engineer's level of knowledge of experience.
* Second detail
etc.


### Senior
...


### Principal
...
