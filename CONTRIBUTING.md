# Contributing

## Guidelines

Please read and be familiar with our standardized [UI Guidelines](https://engineering.rallyhealth.com/ui-guides) when contributing new code to the repository. PRs that adhere to all guidelines will save everyone time as they are under review.

## Pull Request Policy

- At least two approvals from the [CODEOWNERS](.github/CODEOWNERS).
- PRs with blocking reviews should not be merged.
- Do not open a non-draft PR that is still a work in progressâ€”open it as a [draft PR](https://github.blog/2019-02-14-introducing-draft-pull-requests/) instead.
- Avoid pinging contributors on Slack to review a PR (except in an emergency, which should be very rare). Please use the [Request a review](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/requesting-a-pull-request-review) feature. If you don't get a review within a reasonable amount of time, @ mention the [`@AudaxHealthInc/ui-interview-advocates`](https://github.com/orgs/AudaxHealthInc/teams/ui-interview-advocates/members) _in a comment inside of the Github PR_.
