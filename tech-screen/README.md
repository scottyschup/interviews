# Tech Screen Interview

Tech screens should follow this three-part format.

## Part 1

Use the first 5-10 minutes for introductions and high level "softer" questions. Things like:

* "What's one thing about frontend work that you are passionate about and why?"
* "What are you looking for in your next job, whether at Rally or otherwise?"
* "If you could change one thing about your current job's tech stack, what would it be and why?"

## Part 2

Use the bulk of the tech screen for one or more exercises that, in total, should cover CSS, HTML, and JavaScript.

Try to include at least some basic questions about accessibility and testing as well, even if just things like "What, if anything, do you do to make sure your code meets accessibility standards?" and "How do you unit test your code"? 

If the candidate has experience in a framework you feel comfortable asking about, it's okay to ask a question in that framework (e.g., building a React component). However, don't grill the candidate on the framework unless you know the hiring manager wants that.

It's okay to give multiple, smaller, self-contained exercises. For example, you might ask a basic CSS/HTML question, followed by a pure JavaScript question and/or (if the candidate has React experience) a basic React component. You could then ask some basic testing and accessibility questions related to the component, for example.

Another approach is to have a single problem that covers all the bases, or that you build on to incorporate more challenges as the candidate progresses. For example, you might start with a question that involves basic CSS and HTML, but then add requirements that rely on the candidate using JavaScript to provide enhanced features. You might then ask about testing features as they get added, and make some of the features have accessibility elements to them.

The important thing is to try to get a sense of the candidate's broader front-end skillset. Don't spend the whole tech screen on a pure coding algorithm, for example, or on a complicated CSS-only question. 

## Part 3

Use the last 5-10 minutes for Q&A. This is the candidate's chance to ask you questions about working at Rally, etc.
