# UI Interviews

A home for materials that help streamline interviewing UI Engineering candidates at Rally.

## Contributing

PRs are welcome! But before contributing, check out the [Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Interview Structure

Front-end interviews at Rally begin with an initial Technical Screen that lasts 45 minutes or an hour (it can vary by area).

If the candidate passes the Tech Screen, then they get scheduled for a half-day of interviews consisting of the following slots:

* Architecture (usually 1 hour, sometimes 45 minutes)
* Coding (45 minutes)
* CSS/HTML (45 minutes)
* Culture (45 minutes)

The order of the slots varies by interview, based on interviewer schedules, etc.

Front-end interviewers may sometimes be asked to do the Coding slot for Full-stack candidates. Full-stack interviews at Rally have differing formats based on the specific hiring needs. If you get asked to do a Full Stack Coding slot you can treat it as you would a Front-end Coding one. I.e., you are not expected to ask Back-end interview questions.

When in doubt, ask the recruiter organizing the interview for more information, or coordinate with the other interviewers to figure out a plan.

## Interview Questions

This repo houses questions that have been reviewed and approved for use in Rally front-end interviews, so feel free to pull from them. If you run into any problems with any of the approved questions in the repo, or have any ideas on how to improve or change them, please submit a PR! If you have your own interview questions that you prefer, please submit a PR to add them to the repo!

For Technical Screens, see the README in the [`tech-screen`](tech-screen) folder for more information, and of course any questions in that folder as well. Some questions in the [`css`](css), [`html`](html), [`javascript`](javascript), and [`react`](react) folders can also be used in technical screens, so consult those as needed.

For Architecture slots, see the README in the [`architecture`](architecture) folder for more information and see Architecture questions in there as well.

For Coding slots, we generally ask JavaScript or React questions, so see the [`javascript`](javascript) and [`react`](react) folders for those.

For CSS/HTML slots, see the [`css`](css) and [`html`](html) folders. Some of those questions combine aspects of both CSS and HTML, while others focus more on one or the other.

NOTE: In general, candidates are allowed to look up things online, just as we all do everyday as part of our regular engineering work. You can offer to "be their google", and look things up for them. Or you can just have them tell you what they are looking up. We do not expect candidates to have everything memorized. If a candidate needs to look up some css attribute details, needs a reminder of RegEx formats, can't remember the exact ES6 syntax for creating a new Set from an Array, etc., it's completely fine for them to look it up. Of course if a candidate needs to google the entire heart of the question, then that would be a worry.

## Interviewer Behavior

Be kind, be courteous, be empathetic. Candidates are often nervous, and we want to do our best to make them feel comfortable. Try to think of the interview as more of a collaborative process; it's absolutely not meant to be adversarial.

If a candidate has a particularly bad case of interview nerves, consider doing something like taking a few minutes to turn the camera off, mute all mics, and let them do some deep breathing exercises or brief meditation.

## Evaluating Candidates

The questions in this repo should have information on levelling candidates, as far as technical matters go. But we also want to make sure a candidate would make for a good colleague more generally. If you come across any interpersonal red flags in your interview (rude behavior, inappropriate comments, etc.), please raise them in your interview feedback and in the roundup meeting. If you feel uncomfortable doing that, you can instead reach out directly to the recruiter, hiring manager, or a fellow interviewer you feel comfortable talking to.

For information on how to fill out your interview evaluations in Greenhouse, see the [Filling out Scorecards](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1yDFZfw7SZgZrFWKVt1X6ZKPG1uuzpKOV8UFJWB9NpeE/edit?ts=5e3afc4e#slide=id.g381b644241_0_147) section in the [Engineering Interviews wiki](https://wiki.audaxhealth.com/display/REC/Engineering+Interviews). Remember to make your evaluations detailed and focused on the relevant technical aspects.
