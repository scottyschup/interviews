This is meant as a high-level guide to help people write questions for the Architecture interview slot.

In general, an Architecture slot should focus on bigger picture design questions that do not involve explicit coding. Questions that would require white boarding, or a similar virtual tool, are a good fit for this slot.

Here is a not-exhaustive set of concepts and ideas that would be good to cover in the Architecture slot:
1. Session management between applications
1. High-level design of a multiple service-multiple app solution (What clients are responsible for what? What backend services are responsible for what?)
1. Route-level structure
1. Sharing state between routes
1. High-level handling of async requests

Things NOT to focus on in the Architecture slot include:
1. Framework-specific component building at the code level. Those sorts of questions should go in the JavaScript slot. E.g., "Please code this simple React app" should go as a JavaScript question (or maybe as part of a Tech Screen).
1. Detailed CSS or HTML questions. Those should go in the HTML/CSS slot.
